        "# Project Title: “Which Headline Works Better? A/B Testing with Real API Data”\n",
        "\n",
        "Project Brief: You’re working as a data analyst for a media platform, experimenting with different article headlines and post timings. Your task is to simulate an A/B test using real-world data pulled from a news API and analyze engagement trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Project Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Acquisition\n",
        "- Use a public API to pull article or post data (e.g., news headlines, timestamps, source, and categories).\n",
        "- Suggested APIs: (i) NewsAPI – for headlines, timestamps, sources (ii) The Guardian API – for article metadata (iii) Mediastack – real-time and historical news articles (iv) GNews – headlines and publishing data\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Simulate an A/B Test Group\n",
        "- Randomly assign each article as part of either Group A or Group B: Group A: Articles published in the morning (6 AM–12 PM) Group B: Articles published in the evening (6 PM–12 AM)\n",
        "- Alternatively, use headline length or sentiment (if supported) as the test variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Data Cleaning & Exploration\n",
        "- Explore the data using Pandas: check structure, types, and index.\n",
        "- Subset and filter the data using .loc[] and .iloc[]\n",
        "- Handle any missing data using: fillna() with median or mode Interpolation, if appropriate\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Analysis & Visualization\n",
        "- Use groupby(), aggregation, and NumPy ufuncs to analyze: Engagement by group (e.g., article length, source, time of publication) Distribution of article metadata (length, source frequency, etc.)\n",
        "- Identify and remove outliers based on article word count or number of shares.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. A/B Test and Interpretation\n",
        "- Conduct a basic A/B test comparing Group A and B using scipy.stats.ttest_ind\n",
        "- Visualize the comparison using bar plots or box plots.\n",
        "- Interpret the p-value and assess statistical significance.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Deliver Key Insights\n",
        "- Recommend which group (e.g., headline length or post time) performs better.\n",
        "- Comment on how missing data or outliers may have influenced the test result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tools Required:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python (Jupyter Notebook preferred)\n",
        "- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, requests\n",
        "- Optional: seaborn, wordcloud for creative visualizations\n",
        "\n",
        "Expected Deliverables:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Jupyter Notebook\n",
        "- Markdown & Jupyter Notebook cells showing: i) API call and response ii) Data cleaning process iii) A/B test setup and results\n",
        "- The final summary of insights with charts is shared as a document link in your notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bonus Resources:\n",
